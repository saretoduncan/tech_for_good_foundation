# Peer-to-Peer Philanthropy Platform

A peer-to-peer philanthropy platform transforming giving into a collaborative movement.  
Founders launch projects, Co-Founders boost them, and Contributors join in â€” creating real change together.

## ðŸš€ Concept

This project reimagines philanthropy by making giving personal, transparent, and impactful.  
Instead of one-way donations, itâ€™s a shared journey where everyone has a stake:

- **Founders** â†’ Initiate projects that matter to them.  
- **Co-Founders** â†’ Amplify and support those projects.  
- **Contributors** â†’ Join the movement by lending their support.  

Together, these roles create a dynamic ecosystem where generosity fuels meaningful change.
